                <h2>Private Club in Washington DC</h2>
                <h5>Multi-Building Renovation & Structural Underpinning</h5>
            <strong>The Challenge:</strong>
                <p>
                  The club facilities had not kept pace with the expanding membership. Renovation of existing facilities was required to update the style and look of the club to better reflect the changing times. The kitchen and back of house support areas were in need of updating to support the newly expanding lounge and dining facilities.
                </p>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong>
                <p>
                  Expanding the existing club into newly purchased adjacent properties allowed for  needed expansion. By pairing pre-function rooms with individual architecturally significant styled dining rooms the club was able to provide members with private lounges with attached dining accommodations.
                </p>
                <p>

        Expanding the clubâ€™s basement areas by underpinning three buildings dating from the late 1700's to the early 1900's with vastly different foundation conditions, enabled a 30% increase in support areas and additional pre-function and dining rooms. This maximized the investment in infrastructure by creating multiple income producing lounges and dining rooms for member functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individual architectural styles were selected to reflect the diversity of the spaces selected for lounges and dining rooms. The styles selected ranged from the Victorian lounge accessed through hidden doors (in linen fold paneling from an English manor house), to the Garden Room, Williamsburg Room and Georgian Room.
