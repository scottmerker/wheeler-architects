                <h2>Washington, DC Communications Association</h2>
                <h5>Space Planning and Interior Design</h5>
            <strong>The Challenge:</strong>
                <p>
                  A new association needed to express their brand with a new interior design.
                </p>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong>
                <p>
                  Create a new look for the association utilizing transparency, light and free form features for utilitarian business functions. The centrally located interior lobby was designed with translucent light features to bring light into the interior. At the entry hall, new “staff mailboxes” were incorporated in a sculptural wall-mounted twisted grid. Individual staff stations were created with future flexibility in mind. Translucent interior “windows” bring light into the interior while maintaining privacy in the offices.
