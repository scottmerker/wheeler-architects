                <h2>Belle Haven Addition and Whole House Renovation</h2>
                <h5>Whole House Renovation and Addition</h5>
                <strong>The Challenge:</strong>
                <p>
                  The contract purchasers had wanted to live in this sought after community. This original-owner home had no real changes or updates since its initial construction and came on the market requiring a complete transformation.
                </p>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong>
                <p>
                  Zoning and topography restricted the design to a side and rear addition. Taking design cues from the original home we added an addition set back from the existing structure in deference to the strongly symmetrical front. The addition included a new two car garage in the basement in place of the previous one car. Above the garage we added a new kitchen and family room and a two-story breakfast room that is open to the hall above. The upper floor received the new master bedroom and en-suite bath.
                </p>
                <p>

  Looking at the front elevation you will note the difference in the dormer on the addition and the dormers on the original home. The drawings showed the new dormer to be identical to the original ones. This was one case where the owner elected to do work with the contractor on his own. The contractor did not follow the drawings in constructing the new dormer. As a result the new dormer does not match the existing dormers. We noticed it when it was framed out and raised the issue with the owner. The contractor had convinced him that this was the better solution. We leave it up to you to decide.
</p>
<p>
  We prefer to perform services during construction because we can monitor and verify that what is constructed is according to the documents. We also believe that of the three parties to the construction, the owner, contractor and architect, the owner is usually the least experienced member of the team and is not always aware of their options. We view it as our job to educate them and help them look after their interests.
