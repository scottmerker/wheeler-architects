                <h2>Beverly Hills Addition and Renovation</h2>
                <h5>Whole House Renovation and Addition</h5>
                <strong>The Challenge:</strong>
                <p>
                  This family of six wanted to update their home to serve their growing and changing needs. The existing home did not take full advantage of the beautiful site overlooking a deeply forested ravine.
                </p>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong>
                <p>
                  Our goal was to bring nature in through the use of large windows and a double height space in the great room. Extensive built-ins and window seats allow reading in the sun-dappled light of day while taking in the view through the branches of the mature trees. We added an addition to the rear to accommodate an expanded kitchen/family room with an informal dining space beneath the large scale windows. Beyond the family room is an enclosed screen porch with translucent roof to direct more light into the home.   The new design delivers an ever-changing view throughout the day drawing your attention over the forested ravine.
                </p>
                <p>
                On the second floor a new bedroom allowed all the children to have their own space. By relocating the washer and dryer, it is now conveniently adjacent to the bedrooms. Opening the stair landing, and installing a sky light and fan utilizes natural convection to naturally cool the house.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The homes several previous additions created some challenges when the walls and floors were opened during construction. Some framing members needed to be relocated to avoid existing beams. Radiant heat in the floors helps to minimize childhood allergies and low VOC paints and building materials allowed for immediate occupancy without having to worry about materials off gassing.
