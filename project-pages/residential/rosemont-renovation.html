                <h2>Alexandria Addition and Renovation</h2>
                <h5>Whole House Renovation and Addition</h5>
                <strong>The Challenge:</strong>
                <p>
                  Approaching the house required a walk up a steep path. An ill-defined front door location and minimal stair and landing to the one story porch made it difficult to know where the entry was from the street. The house opened directly into the living room with no dedicated entry or coat closet. The owners also desired a home office and space for their extensive book collection.
                </p>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong>

                <p>
            A formal brick stair was added and the path leveled to be more accessible. By enclosing the existing porch and adding a second floor above and we were able to add space within the existing homes footprint, saving money on foundations. The new first floor space allowed a new covered porch at the front door, a formal entry and coat closet. This opened to a new den with large glazed openings to bring the rear garden into view. A new spiral stair leads to the second floor library with large windows at the front that both identified the entry and opened views through the mature trees.
