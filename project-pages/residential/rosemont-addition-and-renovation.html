                <h2>Rosemont Addition</h2>
                <h5>Second Story Addition/Whole House Renovation</h5>
                <strong>The Challenge:</strong>
                <p>
                  This single-story home was entirely too small for the family that had recently bought it. The growing family needed to more than double the space in order to accommodate their family and do in a limited period of time. Located on a tight site, the zoning setbacks prevented a second floor built directly over the first. To build upon the existing structure would have required a public hearing and regulatory approval that might not be granted. We informed the owners of how a costly application for a variance would add over four months and several thousand dollars to the project with no guarantee of success.
                </p>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong>

                <p>
            We designed the second floor to be set back eighteen inches from the existing first floor to comply with the zoning setback. By doing so we were able to build the second floor addition by right. Treating this setback architecturally as a side roof and moving the front elevation out six inches we created the impression of depth minimizing the importance of a side bump out on the front elevation. This architectural sleight of hand saved the owner the additional time and money that securing a zoning variance would have cost, allowing them to occupy and enjoy their home six months sooner and still accomplish all of their goals for the design.
