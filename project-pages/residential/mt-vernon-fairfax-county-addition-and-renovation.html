                <h2>Mt Vernon Addition and Renovation</h2>
                <h5>Whole House Renovation and Addition</h5>
                <strong>The Challenge:</strong>
                <p>
                An estate sale precipitated the renovation and addition to this early original early 20th century stone house on a large lot. Never having been updated the home was functionally obsolete and in need of all new utilities and services.
                </p>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong>
                <p>
                  The small stone cottage required a deft hand at design to not overpower the relatively small original structure. Positioning the addition behind and setting it back from the original structure leaves the maximum area of stone exposed making the original structure appears larger than it is. The program called for new bedrooms, baths, garage, master bedroom and bath, en-suite, au pair suite, informal dining area, rear stair, side entry and family room.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Building the addition to the rear allowed for the new kitchen, informal dining area and a family room with cathedral ceiling. This is the heart of the renovated home and where the family congregates for daily living. Building to the driveway side of the site garnered a new two car garage with master suite above. The L formed by the garage creates an area sheltered from the prevailing north winds. The kitchen, and informal dining are open to a large deck that joins these areas to the rear yard. Extending the roof of the family room creates a covered porch and deck.
