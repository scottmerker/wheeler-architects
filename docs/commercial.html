             We do this by using proven design management tools and advanced 3D virtual reality technology to help you to better understand your design decisions.</p>

             We believe that the same skills developed in our residential practice are directly transferable to our commercial work. At our core we believe that a successful design will produce a healthy, well functioning environment and a better life for all. We achieve this through smart planning and a specialization in retail and light commercial design. We know that a well designed space makes people feel good.</p>

            When Starbucks expanded to the east coast, they selected Wheeler Architects to assist them. We successfully opened their first 23 stores throughout the Washington metropolitan area.</p>

When a client in their newly-renovated business said "we knew it was going to be lovely, the model showed us that, but we never realized exactly how much better it would function".

            Are you opening a business for the first time? Are you in the market to lease or buy a property for your companies future home? Is your business doing so well that it is necessary to relocate or expand? </p>
         <p>

Don’t wait until after you have made your expensive investment to find out that you have made a mistake and there are restrictions or unknown conditions that will limit what you can do with your property or generate unanticipated costs.
             We see too often businesses who lease or purchase a property with the intent of moving, expanding or opening the new business, without fully understanding the restrictions or costs involved with such an endeavor.</p>
         <p>
             This can lead to unexpected cost overruns, time delays, disruptions to your business, and/or compromises in creating or relocating your business. The Washington metropolitan area is a heavily regulated environment with many potential pitfalls for the unwary.

        <p>
          "I've known, worked with and respected Michael Wheeler since 2003. I met him at a time when I was in desperate need of a competent, licensed and available architect for a new building I had in Alexandria, Virginia. I had recently found out that a person I was working with and who claimed to be able to provide architectural services for this Alexandria construction project, was in fact not licensed in Virginia. I had to make a change immediately and have plans for the building completed quickly to avoid further unexpected down time and a mostly vacant building. Most firms were either too busy to add me to their schedule in a reasonable amount of time or too small for their firm. Michael was able to get started within a few days and have the plans ready shortly thereafter. He had years of experience with the City of Alexandria and was able to guide me through what could have been a difficult permitting process. I saved countless hours and finished the project close to its original target date.
            </p><p>
            That experience paved the way for our future relationship which continues to this day. I think three words best describe Michael Wheeler and Wheeler Architects, honest, experienced and dependable. I wouldn't consider anyone else when thinking of architectural services or just some good advice. "

              “When looking at a possible site to relocate our growing company, we needed to undertake a space fit-and-budget analysis to determine if it was the right site for us. Your analysis and space planning options helped provide the information we needed to make an informed decision. We valued the insight you offered into how a creative interpretation of the building code could save us time and money. We appreciate the creative solutions for optimizing our space that you came up with. You were a pleasure to work with and we would unreservedly recommend you”

          “Michael Wheeler did multiple projects for me. He built a beautiful sunroom onto my home which awes and inspires everyone. And twice he provided space planning services for our Alexandria offices, working with the City to obtain regulatory approval to convert an attic storage space into charming, functional and welcoming new offices. I would use him again and recommend him without hesitation.”

          "The interior architectural details you created for us — particularly in those very prominent and important public spaces such as the main dining room, the library, the lobby and the main lounge — were exquisite, thoughtful, gracious and elegant.
          </p><p>
          No doubt you share our pride in knowing that the American Institute of Architects chose The Charter House as a stop on a tour of retirement housing in the Washington area which it organized for AIA members. The AIA is not alone in doing that; the National Association of Home Builders also brought by two bus loads of its members. Innumerable developers, architects, builders and other professionals have come to The Charter House to see what we did and, in so doing, to pay us and you very high compliments.
          </p><p>
          Such words are music to our ears, of course, but important as the view of the industry professionals is, another audience is even more important.  I refer here to our market, senior citizens who are considering The Charter House as a place to live. This, in the final analysis, is the true test of any architectural endeavor. And it is here that you receive the highest compliments, for we have found that the opinion of this market about the look of The Charter House is that it achieves exactly the balance between elegance and comfort which we sought. Our residents "feel good" in the spaces you worked so hard designing. To us, this is the ultimate testament, and I trust that knowing this is heartening to you as well."
