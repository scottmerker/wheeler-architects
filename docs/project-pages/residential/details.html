                <strong>“God is in the details,” Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886-1969)</strong>
                <p>
                  What was meant by that saying? It has been said that attention paid to small things has big rewards and that details are important. By making sure the smaller elements of a project are properly attended to, the larger issues will resolve themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
            Each project brings with it a myriad of problems to overcome. Each problem has one or many different solutions. Each solution has many influences on it, the owner, the site, the program, the budget and more. It is the architect’s brief to take all of this into account in coming up with the right solution to the owners individual dilemma. By distilling each project down to its essence, we develop the design concentrating on the details to get it right.

            When doing a renovation, it is possible to find a unique detail in the building that can be a catalyst for further design. For example, in the first pictures at right, the brick steps in the fireplace mantle inspired the use of a stepped form. That form was used in the stair, light trough and other ways in the home. This is an example of an existing detail influencing a continuity of form. All inspired by that detail in the fireplace mantle.
