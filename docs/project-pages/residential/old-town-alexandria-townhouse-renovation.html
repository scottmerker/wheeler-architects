                <h2>Old Town Alexandria Townhouse Renovation</h2>
                <h5>Whole House Renovation</h5>
                <strong>The Challenge:</strong>
                <p>
              This townhouse had not been improved since its construction in the 1920's and was in need of a complete updating. There was a severe lack of storage, there were no closets in any of the bedrooms. All of the systems were functionally obsolete.
                </p>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong>
                <p>
                  Our goals were to bring light into the center of the home and create a modern traditional design, playing upon the more historic details in the home and updating everything else to a new modern standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                To accomplish this we added two large skylights and removed walls on the second floor, opening a loft to the floor below. We added a high capacity, reversible ceiling fan to take advantage of natural convection to move air according to the season, cooling in the warmer months and heating in the cooler ones. Removing walls on the second floor opened up the loft to the floor below.  We framed the large windows with built-in bookcases and window seats. The powder room and pantry added on the first floor included new cabinets, a wine fridge and bar sink to serve the dining room and kitchen. A walk-in coat closet and supplies closet was also added on the first floor. Upstairs, custom closets were added in each of the bedrooms. The kitchen features all-white custom cabinetry with an eat-in seating area and is the hub of the home and leads out to a covered porch and fenced yard.
