                <h2>Old Town Alexandria Townhouse Reconstruction and Addition</h2>
                <h5>Third Story Addition/Whole House Renovation</h5>
                <strong>The Challenge:</strong>
                <p>
              This home was entirely too small for the family that had recently bought it. The growing family needed a new bedroom for a soon-to-arrive child and Mom and Dad wanted to include a new master suite and bath.
                </p>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong>
                <p>
                  The back story here is a little more interesting.  The original homeowner had his 1800's townhouse under contract when a catastrophic collapse destroyed the home and its neighbors. He turned to Wheeler & Associates to re-imagine and rebuild the home so he could finally inhabit it. Our goal was to fill the home with light by adding skylights and an atrium and that would extend through the entire house bringing light deep into the interior and creating a vibrant, inviting space. The home was designed to center around a double opening fireplace and the welcoming atrium. We designed the upper floors to be accessed by an open stair and a walkway overlooking the space below, basically creating a bridge to the bedrooms and a loft office with a view.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The new homeowners were thrilled with their home but found they were expecting and did not want to leave. They did a quick search for the original architect and tasked us with designing an addition to accommodate their expanding family. Our solution was to maximize the zoning envelope by raising the roof to the rear of the house, add a new deck, master bedroom and bath to crown the home.The existing master bedroom was turned into a den and the new child's room.
