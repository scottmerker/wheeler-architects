                <h2>Stamford CT Assisted Living Facility</h2>
                <h5>Addition and Renovation</h5>
            <strong>The Challenge:</strong>
                <p>
                  Renovate an existing assisted living facility that was unable to thrive in the existing market.
                </p>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong>
                <p>
                  The goal was to create a traditional, up-scale, residential style to welcome residents to their new home. We created a strong central element to clearly identify the entry with a welcoming portico to shelter residents and provide a front porch to the facility. This new entry oriented residents to the common areas of their new home. In this more public area, we located the public and private dining rooms, main lounges and “living room” of the home.

                </p>
                <p>

        A one story addition to the rear added most of the new support areas for the residents. These included the kitchen, lounges, library, mail room. craft rooms, hair salon, day rooms, chapel, infirmary, multi-purpose room, etc. A new resident wing was added to complete the intended symmetry of the existing building.
      </p>
      <p>
        Age specific accessible design was used to help the residents adapt to their new home. Visual cues, contrasting colors and patterns helped residents with way-finding. Interior design features such as towel bars used as grab bars, shallower sinks for easier reach and lower force devices to facilitate residents ageing in place.
